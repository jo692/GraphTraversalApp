# GraphTraversalApp
Simple app to visualise various graph search and traversal algorithms.

Work in progress.
Currently the app can generate pseudo-random graphs of between 7-10 nodes and the user can select a node as the start node of the algorithms.
Neither DFS or BFS search have been implemented yet, though they will be programmed to work on a weighted graph, considering lowest weight edges first.

To be implemented:
- DFS and BFS buttons.
- Reset graph button which will allow the user to keep the current graph configuration but reset it so that another algorithm can be performed on it.

Possible future improvements/additions: 
- Edge weight checkbox, allowing the algorithm to be executed on both a weighted and non-weighted graph.
- Dijkstra's algorithm button for an optimal route visualisation.
- Allow the user to create custom graphs by placing their own nodes and edges.
